1. Create Different Properties Files: Create different application.properties files for each environment. For example, application-dev.properties for the development environment, application-prod.properties for the production environment
2. Set Active Profile: In your GitHub Actions workflow, set the active profile based on the environment. You can do this by setting the spring.profiles.active environment variable.  For example, if youâ€™re deploying to the production environment, you would set spring.profiles.active=prod
3. Load Properties: Spring Boot will automatically load the properties from the application-{profile}.properties file based on the active profile
------
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Set active profile
        run: echo "spring.profiles.active=prod" >> $GITHUB_ENV
